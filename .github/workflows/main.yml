# NOT replicated if sibling xalan-test directory is present
# Simplest fix would be to have the above test checkout emulate the dev environment;
# better would be to fix fulldist to intelligently check both locations;
# best might be to adopt xalan-test back into the xalan repository, if it's no longer being used elsewhere.
