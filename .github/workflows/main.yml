# as well as having dependencies on some targets which have since been edited
# out. The following is our typical minimal build test as documented in README,
# minus conf.xsltc since that one is currently throwing four known failures and
# isn't set up to say "but that's not a regression".

# NOTE: Adjustments made for mvn build leaving things in a slightly different
# place than ant build did (and recreating /lib).

# Build distribution artifacts: Used to pull xalan-test back down as child and
# run fulldist:
#      run: |
#        ant fulldist
# fulldist isn't currently a separate target in the mvn build process
# A near-equivalent is being performed every time to build the .tar.gz
# and .zip distribution files.
#
# BUT NOTE that the binary distro has traditionally included
# xalan-test as a subdirectory; maven build doesn't yet pull that in.
# Discussion is in progress about whether it is (a) necessary, (b) a good
# idea.
# TODO: REVIEW.
