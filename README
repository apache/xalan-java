This GitHub repos branch has src code provided as Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) build, for 
Xalan-J's implementation of XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 specifications.

Following are the steps to produce Xalan-J's XSL 3 jar file (containing XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 run-time processors),
and running Xalan-J's XSL 3 conformance tests:

1) Set JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a local JDK installation folder. JDK 1.8/8 has been used
to write and test Xalan-J's src code available within this codebase repos. Higher versioned JDK releases would also 
work fine to compile and run Xalan-J XSL processor from this codebase repos.

2) Please ensure that Maven build tool has been installed on local workstation, which is using the JDK specified by 
JAVA_HOME environment variable.

3) Run Maven build command 'mvn clean package -DskipTests', or 'mvn clean install -DskipTests' on the local workstation folder 
where pom.xml file for Xalan-J's maven project is located. This shall produce the Java jar file xalanj-3.0.1.jar 
within local folder /target.

The 'libs' file-system folder available within this GitHub repos branch contains various jar file dependencies as convenience 
to users, that are needed by the main Xalan-J jar file xalanj-3.0.1.jar.

Maven build tool may be used to run only Xalan-J XSL 3 tests, using the following command:

mvn clean test -Dtest=AllXsl3Tests

This produces Maven build output with trailing information like following:

To run Xalan-J's XSL 3 processor for invoking an XSL stylesheet transformation, the jar file xalanj-3.0.1.jar and other 
jar files available within 'libs' folder need to be made available on Java run-time's classpath.   

Please note that, unlike previous Xalan-J versions this build doesn't produce a separate serializer.jar file. Instead,
the jar file xalanj-3.0.1.jar produced by this build contains all the run-time classes and resources of Xalan-J's 
XSL 3 transformation serializer.  

The document https://xalan.apache.org/xalan-j/xsl3/xalanj_xslt3.0_implementation_status.pdf, provides
latest details about Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 implementation status with respect to Xalan-J's 
compliance with these specifications.
