This file primarily, contains instructions to the person(s) who shall be making an Apache XalanJ 
release for distribution, along with the instructions about how to test XalanJ release before 
recommending the release for distribution.

The details mentioned within this file, may also be used, by XalanJ source distribution users to 
build and test XalanJ from the source distribution (except that, "git clone" steps as mentioned 
within this file, might not be required to be run by XalanJ source distribution users).

(1) Steps to build the XalanJ release

1) Do a git clone, of the relevant XalanJ branches:

git clone --single-branch https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan-java.git -b xalan-j_2_7_1_maint

git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan-test.git

This creates two folders: xalan-java and xalan-test

2) Set JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME environment variables, for example:

set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-8.0.352.8-hotspot\

set ANT_HOME=C:\java\apache-ant-1.10.12

3) Run the command, "build clean fulldist" from folder xalan-java.

For XalanJ source distribution users, this command needs to be run from, the root 
of the XalanJ source distribution folder (i.e, from the source distribution folder, 
which contains folders "src", "tools" etc).

(2) Steps to run the XalanJ tests, on XalanJ implementation

1) Go to the XalanJ tests repos's, local git clone folder:
cd ..\xalan-test

For XalanJ source distribution users, xalan-test folder is located at the root of the XalanJ 
source distribution folder (i.e, parallel to folders "src", "tools" etc), from where XalanJ 
source distribution users may run XalanJ tests, by using the "build" script located at 
this folder location.

2) Set JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME environment variables, for example:

set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-8.0.352.8-hotspot\

set ANT_HOME=C:\java\apache-ant-1.10.12

3) Run the command "build clean jar" from folder xalan-test. This produces
the file testxsl.jar that acts as main XalanJ test driver, within folder xalan-test/java/build.

4) Run the necessary XalanJ tests as follows,

The tests described below within points 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 need to be run from folder xalan-test. 

4.1 Run the ant target "smoketest", using following three commands in sequence shown below

build extensions.classes

build extensions

build smoketest

The output of the command "build smoketest" should be following, and without any other build errors,

smoketest-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Smoketest passed!

4.2 Run the ant target "smoketest.xsltc", using following three commands in sequence shown below 

build conf.xsltc

build accept.xsltc

build smoketest.xsltc

The output of the command "build smoketest.xsltc" should be following, and without any other build errors,

smoketest.xsltc-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Smoketest passed!

4.3 Run the ant target "smoketest.dev", using following command

build smoketest.dev

The output of the command "build smoketest.dev" should be following, and without any other build errors,

smoketest-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Smoketest passed!
     
4.4 From folder xalan-test/tests/xsltc_integer_truncation, run the batch file 
xsltc_int_truncation_test.bat (provided for Windows platform) to run test for, 
"XalanJ integer truncation bug fix, when using XSLTC".
