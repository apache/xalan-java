This GitHub repos branch has src code configured as Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) build, for 
Xalan-J's implementation of XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 specifications.

Following are the steps to produce Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 build jar file (containing Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 and 
XPath 3.1 run-time processors) and running Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 conformance tests:

1) Set JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to the local JDK installation folder. JDK version 1.8/8 has been used
to develop and test Xalan-J's src code available within this code base repos. JDK versions greater than 1.8 shall also 
work fine to compile and run Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 processor built from this code base repos

2) Java Maven build tool needs to be installed on local workstation, using JDK installation referred by 
JAVA_HOME environment variable.

3) To successfully run Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 tests available within this test suite (the root folder path for this 
is : src/test/java/org/apache/xalan/tests/main), within the Java class org.apache.xalan.tests.util.XSLTestConstants 
please change the value of class field variables LOCAL_BASE_URI_PREFIX_FOR_TESTS_1 and LOCAL_BASE_URI_PREFIX_FOR_TESTS_2 
as per local workstation where this test suite runs.

4) Run Maven build command 'mvn clean install -DskipTests' from the local workstation folder 
where Maven build's pom.xml file is located. This shall produce the Java jar file xalan-java-3.0.1.jar 
within Maven build's local folder 'target'.

The file system folder 'libs' contains various jar file dependencies, provided as convenience to users, that 
are needed by Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 implementation.

To run Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 conformance tests, the following command needs to be run:

mvn clean test -Dtest=AllXalanXSLT3Tests

The Maven build results like following shall be produced: 

[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------
[INFO]  T E S T S
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Running org.apache.xalan.tests.main.AllXalanXSLT3Tests

If the user needs to run Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 implementation via Java code, the value of JVM's system property 
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory needs to be set to org.apache.xalan.processor.XSL3TransformerFactoryImpl.

5) This code base repos branch also has Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 test drivers for W3C XSLT 3.0 test suite (https://github.com/w3c/xslt30-test).

Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 code repos folder src/test/java/org/apache/xalan/tests/w3c/xslt3 has following Java classes for this purpose:

W3CXSLT3Tests : To run W3C XSLT 3.0 test suite on Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 implementation.

W3CXSLT3TestSuiteXalanResultSummarize : To produce an aggregated W3C XSLT 3.0 test suite results for Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 implementation.

Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 implementation's conformance results with W3C XSLT 3.0 test suite are available at following location : 
https://github.com/apache/xalan-java/blob/xalan-j_xslt3.0_mvn/src/test/java/org/apache/xalan/tests/w3c/xslt3/result/w3c_xslt3_testsuite_xalan-j_result.xml   

The PDF document https://xalan.apache.org/xalan-j/xsl3/xalanj_xslt3.0_implementation_status.pdf, provides 
various other details about Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 implementations.
