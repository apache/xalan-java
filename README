This GitHub repos branch contains source code provided as Maven build (https://maven.apache.org/), for 
Xalan-J's implementation of XSLT 3.0 specification.

Following are the steps to produce Xalan-J's XSLT 3 jar file from this codebase repos:

1) Set JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a local JDK installation folder. JDK 1.8 has been used
to write and test Xalan-J's src code available in this codebase repos. But higher JDK releases would also 
work fine to compile and run Xalan-J from this codebase repos.

2) Please ensure that Maven build tool has been installed locally, which is using the JDK pointed by JAVA_HOME 
environment variable.

3) Run Maven build command 'mvn clean package', or 'mvn clean install' on the local workstation folder 
where pom.xml file for this repos branch is located. This shall produce the Java jar file xalan-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
within local folder /target.

The 'libs' folder of this GitHub repos branch contains various jar file dependencies as convenience to users, that 
are needed by the main Xalan-J jar file xalan-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.

To run Xalan-J's XSLT 3 processor, the jar file xalan-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar and other jar files available within 
'libs' folder need to be made available on Java run-time's classpath.   


The document https://xalan.apache.org/xalan-j/xsl3/xalanj_xslt3.0_implementation_status.pdf, provides
latest details about Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 implementation status with respect to Xalan-J's 
compliance with these specifications.
