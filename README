This git repos branch contains source code and a test suite, for Xalan-J's implementation of XSLT 3.0 
(https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) and XPath 3.1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/) specifications.

This readme document contains instructions, on how to make Xalan-J build from this git repos branch. 
To make Xalan-J's build from this git repos branch, an Ant build tool (https://ant.apache.org/) 
is needed.

Following are the steps to make Xalan-J's build from this git repos branch:

1) Set JAVA_HOME environment variable, pointing to a local JDK installation folder.

The codebase within this git repos branch, has been developed and tested using Java 1.8 version.

2) The following two build actions are currently available, on this git repos branch.

2.1) Command : build clean jar
This command produces Xalan-J's binary implementation as Java jar files.

2.2) Command : build clean dist
This command produces Xalan-J's implementation as distribution binary and source archives, 
that shall typically be consumed by Xalan-J users within XML applications. Xalan-J distribution 
archives with names like following shall be produced by this build command:
xalan-j_a_b_c-bin.zip
xalan-j_a_b_c-bin.tar.gz
xalan-j_a_b_c-src.zip
xalan-j_a_b_c-src.tar.gz

The Xalan-J distribution source archives shall also contain, Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 
conformance test suite, within the folder "tests".

The document https://xalan.apache.org/xalan-j/xsl3/xalanj_xslt3.0_implementation_status.pdf, contains
details about Xalan-J's XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 implementation status.
