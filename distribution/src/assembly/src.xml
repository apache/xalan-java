<!-- Based upon Apache standard Source Release Assembly,
     with customizations as needed for Xalan's source
     release bundle.

     1) Has to start scan from parent project, not current project.
     Coded to .. now; should probably use a ${...parent...} reference

             if the standard release process is followed. This is because the 
             release plugin checks out project sources into a location like
             target/checkout, then runs the build from there. The result is
             a source-release archive that comes from a pretty clean directory
             structure.
             
             HOWEVER, if the release plugin is configured to run extra goals
             or generate a project website, it's definitely possible that some
             of these files will be present. So, it's safer to exclude them.
