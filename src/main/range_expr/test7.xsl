        range "to" expression. This XSLT stylesheet, reads arguments
        of XPath range "to" operation from an external XML document.
        This stylesheet, also does an arithmetic evaluation to compute 
        value of one of the XPath range operand, and also groups the 
        data along with re-ordering the groups using xsl:sort instruction. -->
