/**
 * A top-level JUnit 4 test suite class for Xalan-J's XSL 3 specification 
 * implementation. This JUnit tests class is an entry point, to invoke all of
 * the Xalan-J XSL 3 tests supported by this class.
 * 
 * All the XSLT and XPath tests supported by this top-level class, are
 * further split between two JUnit sub test suites  Xsl3TestSuite1 and 
 * Xsl3TestSuite2 that together form the contents of this test suite 
 * (this has been done to reduce the complexity of this XSL test suite 
 * implementation and improve this test suite's run-time performance).
 * 
 * For all the XSL tests supported by this test suite, the XSL transformation's 
 * expected output files (i.e, the gold files) are sensitive to the whitespace 
 * contents available within those files.
