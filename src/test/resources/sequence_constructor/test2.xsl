   <!-- An XSLT stylesheet test, to test the XPath 3.1 sequence construction
        using comma operator.
        
        The XSLT stylesheet example transforms an XML input document into a list
        in which each author's name appears only once, followed by a list of 
        titles of books written by that author. This example assumes that the 
        context item is the bib element in an XML input document.
        
        The XPath expression strings, that're illustrated within this
        XSLT stylesheet are borrowed from XPath 3.1 spec. -->                

   <xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/>

   <xsl:template match="/bib">
      <result>
        <xsl:copy-of select="for $a in distinct-values(book/author)
                                                          return ((book/author[. = $a])[1], book[author = $a]/title)"/>
