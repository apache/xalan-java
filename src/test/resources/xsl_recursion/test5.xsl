  <!-- An XSLT stylesheet test case, to test mutual recursion
       between two XPath 3.1 function item expressions.
       
       The mutual recursion algorithm of the two XPath function item
       expressions, as mentioned within this stylesheet, has been shared by 
       Dimitre Novatchev (ref, https://dnovatchev.wordpress.com/2023/10/04/mutual-recursion-with-anonymous-inline-functions-in-xpath-3/).
