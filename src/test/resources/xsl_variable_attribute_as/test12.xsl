    <!-- An XSLT stylesheet test case, to test the sequence type
         declaration attribute "as" on an xsl:variable instruction.
         
         Within this stylesheet example, a numeric string is specified
         as child content of an xsl:variable instruction, which is cast
         to the type xs:integer when the variable is evaluated.
         
         We emit the value of variable once by xsl:copy-of instruction,
         and then by xsl:value-of instruction.
